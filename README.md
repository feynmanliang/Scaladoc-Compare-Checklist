# Scaladoc Compare Checklist
Imports scaladoc diff generated by `scaladoc-compare`, parses into JSON,
displays diff changes as a checklist meteor app, and records who reviews
them in MongoDB.

## Setup
 1. Generate scaladoc with `-raw-output` flag and then compare them
    against old version using `scaladoc-compare`.
    * For Spark, I did this by modifying `build/SparkBuild.scala` to
      include the `-raw-output` flag and then running `build/sbt doc`
 2. Save file to `private/data/scaladoc-compare.diff` then run
    `convertToJson.py` to generate `private/data/diffs.json` and
    `private/data/files.json`
 3. Run `meteor reset` to clear MongoDB and then `meteor` to start app.
    The generated JSON data will automatically be loaded into MongoDB.
